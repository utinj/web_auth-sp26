<h2 id="top">What’s With the Trash?</h2>
	<p>I’m somewhat of a hoarder. I do throw things away when absolutely necessary of course, but I have a hard time throwing away random bits and bobs. This week, I wanted to consciously document the things I threw out as a way to learn more about myself, and find a better way of deciding what should truly be trash. That way, I would be less likely to keep needless things and reduce unnecessary spending.</p>
	<p>There’s a lot that you can learn from trash; what people eat, the things they entertain themselves with, what random items they use in daily life. I hope that you can get some understanding of my stories as I do for myself. Besides, trash can be valued as an art in itself, like how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/special-series/vik-muniz-brazil-garbage-art.html" target="_blank"> Vik Muniz explains here.</a></p>
	<p>In modern times, trash is a fact of life. The things that we manufacture, the trinkets we buy, and the mementos we give and get all become trash far too easily. There are simply too many things to keep track of and consider. So, throughout this article, I’d like to reminisce on a few items and perhaps understand whether they truly deserved to become trash. As <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/archaeologist-talks-trash" target="_blank">Sarah Newman puts it</a>, "... there is no unmaking our actual waste, but I think we can unmake the idea that it is an inevitable part of human life."  </p>
	<p>Nontheless, it's important to understand that trash itself is a lot more complicated than the singular word that encompasses it. With incidents like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/24/magazine/landfill-calabasas-los-angeles-wildfire-ash.html" target="_blank">the Los Angelos fires of 2025</a>, entire homes and livelihoods become part of 'trash'. Trash is an all too important deal in our lives that doesn't get explored as much as it could be, so I hope these articles continue to shed some light on the topic.</p>
<h2 id="over">Overview</h2>
	<p>In this week of disposal, many of my items were things given to me, and not acquired directly by my own purchases. It’s a pattern that generally lines up with my own life; I don’t particularly buy items that aren’t food that often. Most of my own item purchases are generally larger ones, like nice electronics that I tend to keep for multiple years on end. I’d like to think this reflects well on myself as someone who is more frugal and mindful of the things I buy, but that does not mean I lack my own fair share of trash.</p>
	<p>Some of these items came from my direct purchase, while others were obtained from elsewhere. As I mentioned before, I tend to have a habit of hoarding things, as I can be particularly sentimental. I also have a habit of believing something will be useful someday and thus keep things I may not truly need. Throwing a few of these items out and putting extra care into their stories could let me tune my relationship with trash into something less avoided and more mindfully done.</p>
<h2 id="p1">Unsatisfying Results</h2>
	<p>This first group of items consists of those that either broke or in some way, did not meet my expectations. These are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus" target="_blank">stylus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator" target="_blank">calculator</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger#Mobile_phone_charger" target="_blank">charging brick</a>. Notably, these three items are the ones that I have bought for myself, intending to use them. </p><p>I got the stylus for when I first came to college in my first semester. During that time, I got a new laptop, which I am currently using and am quite satisfied with. I was in a math class, and thought that being able to note down equations would be quite useful. My laptop has a touch screen, so I thought the stylus would work well. As it turns out, it was surprisingly cumbersome to write with it. The detection of the screen and the physical stylus was unfortunately very spotty, and writing would come out with random gaps. Since then, I had bought a digital pen that could interface with the laptop's pen software, unfortunately leading me to never pick up the stylus again. </p><p>The calculator was, however, not for a math class. In one of my computer science courses, the midterm required a basic calculator. I had a graphing calculator in the first midterm, but the batteries unfortunately gave out. Additionally, graphing calculators technically were not allowed, so I did not want to risk it. I bought this calculator at Kite and Key, and it worked great for the second midterm. However, its battery is non-replaceable, so when it went out, it had to go. </p><p>As for the charging brick, it does not have much of a story. I used it to charge my electronics before it stopped working, so it must go as well now.</p>
<h2 id="p2">Souvenir Scraps</h2>
	<p>This next group of items consists of items that I have gotten from travel or from friends during a trip. These items include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_golf" target="_blank">mini-golf</a> score tracker, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones#Earphones" target="_blank">earbuds</a> earbuds, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(jewellery)" target="_blank">plastic ring</a>. </p><p>I got the mini-golf tracker from a trip to Long Beach with my best friend from high school. As you can see from the cover, we played a pirate themed course. It had two parts, and the game went for around two whole hours. My friend won the first part, while I had barely won the second part by a few points. I ended up keeping the tracker as I was keeping score in the second part. Since then, it has been lying in my dresser, but there isn’t much reason to keep it longer. </p><p>The earbuds were from a flight back to NJ. It was from a United Airlines flight, which generally seems to provide earbuds to the passengers. I never used them, because I bought my own headphones, but they have been sitting in my backpack since. So, they are going as well. </p><p>Lastly is the cheap plastic ring. I don’t remember exactly when I got it, other than it was given to me by a friend from an arcade. It was one of the cheapest prizes there, and so he got it when he needed to use all his points. Afterwards, he gave the ring to me, and I also kept it in my backpack since then. Unfortunately, it’s an extremely cheap feeling plastic ring I never used or displayed, so I threw it out.</p>
<h2 id="p3">The Surprise Gifts</h2>
	<p>The final group of items consists of things that were given to me. These include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_accessories#Cases" target="_blank">phone case</a> , the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego#Set_themes" target="_blank">Minecraft Lego </a>box, and the booklet with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Daily_Bread" target="_blank">"Our Daily Bread"</a>. </p><p>The phone case was given to me by my dad when I finally upgraded from my iPhone 7. It was brought up during a family trip that I had not changed my phone for an incredibly long time, to the point where the phone itself was considerably slow and didn’t function so well. As a camera and photo storage enthusiast, my dad got the newest iPhone while he gave me his own phone. It came with the case, which I unfortunately do not like. I find that I dislike the texture of the case, and I wanted to have one that I liked, so I never used the case myself and it ended up being resold. </p><p>The Minecraft Lego box was gifted to me back a few years ago on a trip to some amusement park that I don’t completely recall. I ended up building the set and leaving it on a table for a few years until my family moved to a new house. Since then, it has sat in a box for a while. I still like the set itself, but I find no use in keeping the box. </p><p>Finally, the booklet. I got it when I moved into a new apartment last semester in the mail. It was in Korean, not a language I can understand. I assume that a previous tenant was receiving these books, that or it was just junk mail. Putting it through a translator shows that it appears to be a religious book of some sort. With a quick search "Our Daily Bread" appears to be part of a Christian prayer. I’m not religious, nor can I read Korean, so there’s not much point in keeping it. Still, it is somewhat interesting as far as mail can be.</p>
